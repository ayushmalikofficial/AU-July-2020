# Generic Classes #

I have defined 2 classes: myStack and myQueue. Both of them are generic. The size of both queue and stack needs to be specified at the time of object creation. They have been implemented using arrays.
The code for both of them is present in 'Program.cs'. The output of execution of the code is in 'Output_of_Execution.png'.
The input values of different objects created in the 'main' function have been hard-coded for demonstration. I display the use of my generic classes by implementing various functions for: Character-Stack, Integer-Stack, Double-Queue and String-Queue.
