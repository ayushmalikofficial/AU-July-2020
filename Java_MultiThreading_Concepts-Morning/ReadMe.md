# Blocking Queue #

Main.java contains my implementation of Blocking Queue. For easy demonstration, I have implemented it for Integer type. It can be easily modified for other object types as well.
I have shared 4 executions of my Blocking-Queue code in Outputs.pdf. In order to capture the execution of the code, I had restricted the producer to produce only 100 times. In the code which I have submitted these changes have been commented out. The producer produces continuously in the submitted code.
No program execution terminates because the consumers continue to wait for the producer to produce some code.
